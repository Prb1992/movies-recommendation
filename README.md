Movie Recommendation System using Machine Learning with Python


dataset :https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cCkwiVv4mgfl20ntgY3n4yApcWqqZQe6/view


>Libraries used: python, pandas ,Scikit-learn

>Recommendation systems :  are computer programs that suggest recommendations to users depending on a variety of criteria.
      OTT  like amazon prime, netflix , hotstar etc. use recommender systems to help their users find the right product or movie for them.
      
 > There are 3 types of recommendation systems.

1)Demographic Filtering: The recommendations are the same for every user. They are generalized, not personalized. These types of systems are behind sections like “Top Trending”.

2)Content-based Filtering: These suggest recommendations based on the item metadata (movie, product, song, etc). Here, the main idea is if a user likes an item, then the user will also like items similar to it.

3)Collaboration-based Filtering: These systems make recommendations by grouping the users with similar interests. For this system, metadata of the item is not required.    
      
      This project is based on Content-based recommendation engine for movies.


>The approach to build the movie recommendation engine consists of the following steps.

1)Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the data

2)Build the recommendation system

3)Get recommendations



Summary :In this machine learning project, we build movie recommendation systems. We built a content-based recommendation engine that makes recommendations given the title of the movie as input.
